        <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>

    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side
            down, in a single layer on a plate.</li>
        <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture
            evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs, skin-side
            up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs are brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
