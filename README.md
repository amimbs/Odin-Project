## Asking for Help
- A lot of learns ask exactly how to approach a given task or assignment. However figuring out an approach is actually the critical part of any learning journey.
    - "Hey, Im trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I'm gettng a syntax error on Line 12. How can I fix this? Here's my code"
- In sharing your attempt, people know that you've tried and won't suggest things that might not work for you. It also allows them to debug you current iteration of code, rather than sending you down a path that has you start all over again when you might be very close to a solution.

## How does the internet work

### The Internet
- The **internet** is the actually hardware that connects computers, homes, universities, data centers, cities, and nations
- The **World Wide Web** is the software that sits ontop of the hardware that is the internet. 
- When a device makes a **request** via the web, that request and subsequent **response** is broken into **packets** that travel down different lanes of the internet, allowing each packet to travel using the most optimal **band width** and avoid **network traffic**.
- A **router** is a computer that signals and relays traffic to the correct destination (computer to computer).
- A **modem** turns the information from our network into information managable by the tellaphone infrastructure and viceversa.
- **ISP** *Internet Service Providers*

- **IP Address** - *Internet Protocol Address* always 4 numbers seperated by dots that define the location of you computer.
  - **Domain Names** or **Domain Name Servers (DNS)** are the human readable aliases of IP Addresses.
