## Asking for Help
- A lot of learns ask exactly how to approach a given task or assignment. However figuring out an approach is actually the critical part of any learning journey.
    - "Hey, Im tryin gto return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I'm gettng a syntax error on Line 12. How can I fix this? Here's my code"
- In sharing your attempt, people know that you've tried and won't suggest things that might not work for you. It also allows them to debug you current iteration of code, rather than sending you down a path that has you start all over again when you might be very close to a solution.
