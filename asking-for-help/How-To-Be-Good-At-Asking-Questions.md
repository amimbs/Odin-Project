# How to be great at asking coding Questions
- *Asking good questions allows you to be taken more seriously, and get more respect, which matters if you care about your career*

<hr/>

## The Process
1. **Under the code to the best of your ability**
   1. Go through line-by-line and understand each line to the best of your ability
   2. Google unfamiliar concepts
   3. Use a debugger to help you (see [Debugger notes](Debugger.md))
2. **Clearly describe the problem**
   1. Explain the context
   2. Explain the exact steps you took to produce the problem.
   3. Explain what you expect to see.
   4. Explain what you actually see.
3. **Provide the Code that illustrates the problem**
   1. Isolate the issue
   2. Make sure that the code doesn't change by the time someone looks at it.
4. **Make sure the code you're sharing can reproduce the problem**
   1. Take the code you're going to share, and make sure it behaves exactly like you described.
5. **Format your code consistently**
   1. Style doesn't matter, just make sure you're consistent
6. **Check yourself for typos**
   1. Nobody wants to look for your typos
   2. Go back to a point where the code worked and redo from there. Making sure your code continues to work each step of the way. If you get to a point where your code doesn't work. Check for typos.
   3. Go back methodically and figure out where you messed up. Do not waste someone else's time and ask them to do something you should do yourself.
7. **Explain what you did to troubleshoot the problem**
   1. Come up with a list of hypotheses about what the problem might be and then test them methodically. For each hypothesis, explain what you did to test each
   2. During this process you might solve the problem yourself.
8. **Explain what you think the problem might be**
   1. Based on your tests in the previous step, provide your best guess on what you think the problem might be,
9. **Proofread your question**
   1.  Read through your question and make sure you've provide everything that someone would need to answer it.
   2.  Edit for clarity. If you think something might be confusing, fix it. If there’s a typo, fix it. If you have typos in your question, people will assume that you have typos in your code. And like I said before, other people are not your personal typo hunters.
10. **Send updates and remember this will not be your last question**
    1.  If you've figured out the answer before anyone can respond, then tell people so they don't waste time looking for an answer you've already found.
    2.  When you get an answer back, take time to digest it carefully and fully understand what the person is saying. Keep in mind they might not actually be right. So you need to verify that their solution works.
    3.  Thank each person that helped you and remember that they didn’t have to answer your question, but for some reason they wanted to.


## Formatting Your Questions
Asking your questions in a readable format helps everyone debug them better. Here are some ways to go about that:

If you’re having trouble on the command line, make sure to include both your input and the error message you’re getting.

In the chat rooms, code can be displayed differently from normal sentences by using backticks (``), which can be found above the Tab key on US and UK keyboards. Backticks are not the same as single quotation marks (‘’), which are found to the left of the Enter key.

For a single line of code: use one backtick before and after your code.

`Your Code`

For multiple lines of code: use three backticks on a separate line above and below your code.

You can also use code highlighting to add color to your multi-line code by specifying the language:

```javascript
