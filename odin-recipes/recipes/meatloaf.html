    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients and formed into the shape of a
        loaf,
        then baked or smoked. The final shape is either hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed by cooking it in a
        loaf
        pan. It is usually made with ground beef, although ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry, and seafood are
        also used, sometimes in combination. Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation meat or pulses.
    </p>

    <p>
        The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily become dry;
        therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread crumbs and egg, covering it
        with
        sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats,
        rich cheeses, or vegetables.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup soft bread crumbs</li>

        <li>½ cup milk</li>

        <li> ½ pounds ground beef</li>

        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>

        <li>½ cup diced green bell pepper</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)</li>

        <li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>

        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>¼ cup steak sauce, or more to taste</li>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Combine bread crumbs
            and milk in
            a small bowl; set aside to soften.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mix ground beef, onion, bell pepper, steak sauce, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl; add bread
            crumb mixture
            and mix with your hands until combined.
        </li>

        <li>Pat the mixture into the prepared loaf pan; brush the top with 1/4 cup steak sauce.</li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into
            the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow to stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
        </li>
    </ol>
