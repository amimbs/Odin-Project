    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil.
        The
        sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop
        or
        grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.

    <p>
        Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers,
        garlic,
        and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in
        Thai
        cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced shallots</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl
            until well blended.</li>
        <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2
            to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the
            juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of
            the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to
            cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat</li>
        <li>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</li>
    </ol>
