    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf,
        then baked or smoked. The final shape is either hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed by cooking it in a loaf
        pan.[1] It is usually made with ground beef, although ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry, and seafood are
        also used, sometimes in combination. Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation meat or pulses.

    <p>
        The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily become dry;
        therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread crumbs and egg, covering it with
        sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats,
        rich cheeses, or vegetables.
