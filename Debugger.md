# How to use the chrome debugger
1. You can add the **debugger** method inside a function and run the code
2. Once the functions runs, go to your sources tab in chrome from the dev tools
3. You can navigate the function by stepping into it, and see the break down line by line.
4. The **step over** button does as it says, and steps over any function nested instead the function you're debugging, it will run the nested function but will not enter it's body. If you use the **step in** button on a nested function, it will enter the body and break it down line by line just as the parent function.
